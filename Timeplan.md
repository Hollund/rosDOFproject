## Project parts

    Rapport 
        timeplan
        methodology
        problem formulation 
        board text
        translate documentation 

    documentation 
    1. research
    2. install 
    3. Docker usage
    4. workflow
    5. behaviors 
        Each part/behavior documented 
    6. simulation 
    7. GUI 
    8. test
    9. how to use guide

    Work on robot/sim
    
    robot behaviors 
    1. pick up coin 
    2. place coin in hand 
    3. place coin between thumb and index finger 
    4. move coin from thumb-#1 to index finger #1-#2 
    5. repeat measure
    6. get coin to palm 
    7. put down coin 

    final product
    some sort of of gui plug in 
    1. Specify the GUI requirements
    2. specify simulation requirements
    3. specify time constants 

    Dimension analysis / DOF analysis / math stuff
    1. math we use
    2. the simulation
    3. path solving 

    maybe 
    1. simplification maybe ?
